The data provided was the results of a pharmaceutical study testing four different drugs in mouse. We were provided with a mouse ID, the drug administrated, sex, age, weight, timepoint and tumor volume per mouse. Whit the information mentioned above we were able to conclude the following:

- The highest average tumor volume was caused by Ketrapil (55.24 mm3) versus the lowest tumor volume by Capomulin (40.68 mm3) with a difference of 14.56 mm3.
- On the bar chart we can observe how the most used two drugs were Capomulin and Ramicane and the rest drug and the rest were used a very similar amount of times. The pie bar is going to show us how the sex of the mouse was pretty close comparing male to female with only a 2% different, showing us that the sex of the mouse seems to not affect the trial.
